# Zillow-Quandl-Real-Estate-Data
This is a project checking out Zillow/Quandl Real Estate Data. It's largely an attempt to automate queries with Jupyter Lab widgets.


### In the future, there are a few specific things I want/need to do.
- Switch over the usage of metro_df for the dropdown lists, no longer generating codes that could return a 404. It'll probably all be prettier that way as well.
- Annotate plots automatically. Will likely have to enrich metro_df towards this end.
- Look into options for interactive plots.
- Clean names containing special symbols. The dropdowns alone might already reveal some issues.
- Jupyter Widgets seem more versatile that I had known. Will enrich displays and options as I learn more.
- Add predictive analytics.
